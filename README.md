TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.

From beginner to expert can use TensorFlow to learn and make project about machine learning.

Why TensorFlow?

1. TensorFlow is a great machine learning platform
TensorFlow has been created by the end of 2015 and developed by senior developer to reach a bigger audience for studying AI and machine learning.
2. Simplify interaction
Coding in TensorFlow is like interacting with another programmer or developer, so it is easier and more efficient to write code and debugging.
3. Multi language
TensorFlow supports many language such as python, R, swift, javascript
4. Easier to learn
We don't need to start the code from scratch because we can learn from other's code.
5. Easy model building
Build and train ML models easily using intuitive high-level APIs like Keras with eager execution, which makes for immediate model iteration and easy debugging.
6. Powerful experimentation for research
A simple and flexible architecture to take new ideas from concept to code, to state-of-the-art models, and to publication faster.
7. Large community
A diverse community of developers, enterprises and researchers are using ML to solve challenging, real-world problems. Learn how their research and applications are being powered by TensorFlow
